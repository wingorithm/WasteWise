 3. **Scan Screen**, 
    The magic plays in this screen, child may show the trash to the camera and system will leverage google vision + our directory scoring AI algorithm to predict the classification of the trash.

 4. **Guide Screen**,
    With interactive and user-friendly animations, our education and guidance can be delivered seamlessly. Make the children eiger to use and follow the guidece to dispose trash properly. We believe that with this learning by doing activity, children's mindsets can slowly be nurtured to become better

 5. **Rewarding Screen**, 
    Lastly, we also understand how important it is to reward their actions. It's as simple as saying “Good Job”, and showing the impact their actions have on the world. This award can be an affirmation that they are doing the right thing.
